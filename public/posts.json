      "### Introduction",
      "Every escort has *that* client—the one who changes everything. I didn’t know it at the time, but that night was going to alter the course of my life forever. It started like any other appointment, but it ended with a message that still haunts me to this day: *“I know your secret.”*",
      
      "Looking back now, I realize that moment wasn’t just an anomaly—it was the first piece of a puzzle I’m still putting together.",
      
      "When people hear the word “escort,” they make assumptions—usually wrong ones. Sure, there are the fancy dinners and expensive gifts, but that’s just the surface. Beneath the glamour lies a life of constant adaptation: reading people, adjusting to their expectations, and always staying one step ahead.",
      
      "For me, it wasn’t just a job—it was a carefully curated double life. By day, I was just another person blending into the crowd, but by night, I was someone else entirely. I liked it that way. The separation kept me safe. Until that night.",
      "### The Client",
      "It was supposed to be a straightforward booking. He requested dinner at one of the city’s most exclusive restaurants, a place where the lighting is dim, and secrets are easily kept. He was older, well-dressed, and spoke with a quiet confidence that immediately disarmed me.",
      
      "I’ve met my share of charismatic clients, but there was something different about him. He didn’t feel like a man looking for company—he felt like a man with a purpose.",
      "### The Proposition",
      "Then, just as dessert arrived, he leaned forward and said something that sent a chill down my spine: *“I have a proposition for you.”*",
      
      "I remember laughing, thinking it was just playful banter. But his expression didn’t change. He reached into his pocket, pulled out a small envelope, and slid it across the table. 'Open it later,' he said, leaning back in his chair like he had just won a game I didn’t know we were playing.",
      "### The Envelope",
      "When I got home that night, curiosity got the better of me. I tore open the envelope and found a single card inside with two words scrawled neatly across it: *“Follow me.”*",
      
      "Underneath the message was a phone number, no name, no explanation. I stared at it for what felt like hours, torn between intrigue and fear. I’ve had clients try to extend our professional boundaries before, but this felt… different.",
      "### The Message",
      "For days, I avoided calling the number. Something about it felt too risky, too personal. But just when I thought I could put the whole thing behind me, my phone buzzed late one night with a message from an unknown number.",
      
      "The text read: *“I know your secret.”*",
      
      "My heart stopped. Who was this man? How did he know anything about me beyond what I allowed him to see? I stared at the message, my mind racing with possibilities. Could it be a prank? A coincidence? Or was there something deeper at play?",
      
      "That’s the moment everything changed. It was no longer just a job or an encounter—it was the beginning of a game I didn’t know the rules to. A game I couldn’t walk away from, even if I wanted to.",
      "### Reflection",
      "Looking back now, I realize that night wasn’t the end of anything—it was just the beginning. And while I don’t have all the answers yet, one thing is certain: this story is far from over."
